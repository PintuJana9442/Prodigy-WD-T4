                                 I am Pintu Jana. I am passionate about learning new skills in the IT industry. I have completed my graduation degree at 2022 B.Sc. ITM(). Now I am currently just completing my post-graduation degree of Master in Computer Application (M.C.A.), but I didn’t get my certificate . that I was waiting for. Skilled in frontend development, I have a strong ability to create engaging user interfaces. However, my ambition extends to eventually becoming proficient in full-stack development. With a proactive approach to learning and a determination to excel, I am committed to evolving into a versatile IT professional.
